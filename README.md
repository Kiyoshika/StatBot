# StatBot
A Discord bot written in C# to do statistical / mathematical operations such as sampling, integrating, etc.
## Project Setup
### Getting the .NET SDK
**Manjaro Linux:** Follow [this](https://dev.to/kelvinmai/how-to-install-dotnet-core-in-manjaro-linux-590a) guide to installing .NET core SDK on Manjaro Linux

**Other OS:** Not sure. If you're on Windows, you can probably install it via Visual Studio.
### Installing Discord Dependencies
Discord dependencies should already be included in bin/ but just incase, follow [this](https://docs.stillu.cc/guides/getting_started/installing.html?tabs=dotnet-cli%2Ccore2-1)  for installing Discord's .NET library (NOTE: use the dotnet CLI if you're on Linux)
### Building Project
After SDK + dependencies are installed, run `dotnet build`. If succesful, now you can contribute!
